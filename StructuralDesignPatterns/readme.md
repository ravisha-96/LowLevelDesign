Structural Design Pattern is a way to combine or arrange different classes and objects
to form a complex or bigger structure to solve a particular requirement.

Types: (ABCDFFP)

1. Adapter Pattern 
    Bridge between existing interface and expected interface
    
2. Bridge Pattern
    This pattern helps to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, so that the two can vary independently.

3. Composite Pattern
4. Decorator Pattern
    (Pizza, Nexon, Punch, FogLight, SeatCover example)
5. Facade Pattern
    Facade means the front wall of a large building
    Used to hide the system complexity from the client
    Example - Brake, Accelarator accessible to the driver but internal working hidden
              AC increase/decrease temp accessible to the user but internal working hidden.
6. Flyweight Pattern
    (DogRobot, HumanRobit, RoboticFactory to cache robots)
7. Proxy Pattern
